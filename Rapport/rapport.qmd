# Introdution
- **Presentation:** We are studying extreme values in weather data, to help us predict extreme weather events.
- **Problems:** Most of the data collected over the years is based on central measures, i.e. means, we are looking fro the maximums. We will also need to find data spread over a large time interval.
- **Benefits:** It is a project that helps everyone, from governments to scientists to worldwide communities, by warning them ahead of time of the possible natural disasters heading their way.

# Planning
## Find relevant data

- Search the internet for data 
- Do a quick summary to check its relevance in order to choose one data set
- Repeat for as many data sets as possible
- Find the most appropriate data set

## Analyse data and find enough extreme values
- Extract characteristics of the variables that have these extreme values
- Study and analyse their graphs
- Study and interpret their measures 

## Create maps to visualise our research
- Discover softwares to display these maps with a legend
- Annotate these maps
- Colour the maps according to a colour gradient indicated in the legend

## Inform citizens of any extreme event that might happen
- Predict these extreme events 
- Keep collecting data to have more accurate predictions

# Data Treatment
- Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values (NA)
- Divide the dataset by meteo station
- Identify the maxmimum per year

##  Procedure
- 


<!-- - We extracted the maximum of precipitation for each year, each station 
- We noticed that we have a lot of missing values for a large period of time
- Upon further inspection, we noticed that some of the stations alternate capting the data ove the years
- We decided not to treat all stations and choose around 40 stations to study ()
- We looked into the isolated stations, as they represent its neighbourhood (whereas if a station is surrounded by others, the other stations may cover up for any missing information it might have), and checked if we have enough data 
- Then, we looked into the stations within the same proximity -->
